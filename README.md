Nicholas_Bishop_Personal_Project
================================

For this personal Project, I decided to make a website that highlighted my knowledge and past experiences in a sort of resume fashion. In it I included:
<ul>
  <li>My current job title and location</li>
  <li>Phone Number</li>
  <li>Email</li>
  <li>Summary of myself</li>
  <li>Leadership Experience/Professional Development</li>
  <li>Projects</li>
  <li>Skills</li>
  <li>Education</li>
  <li>Links to LinkedIn and Github</li>
</ul>
